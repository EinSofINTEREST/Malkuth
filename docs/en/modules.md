# Module System

**[한국어](../ko/modules.md)** | English

Everything deployable in Malkuth is a module: a solution is assembled by wiring versioned
modules, never by editing framework code. Normative rules:
[04-module-system.md](../../.claude/rules/04-module-system.md) and
[09-memory-context.md](../../.claude/rules/09-memory-context.md).

## Module Types

| Type | Declares | Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Skillset** | Python tools (capabilities) | `modules/skillsets/{name}/{version}/` |
| **Promptset** | Jinja2 templates + variable schemas | `modules/promptsets/{name}/{version}/` |
| **Memoryset** | Memory policy — scope, index, retention, recall | `modules/memorysets/{name}/{version}/` |
| **Agent** | Contract — model, modules, protocols, resources | `agents/{name}/manifest.yaml` |
| **Graph** | Goal — nodes, edges, connections, mode | `graphs/{name}.yaml` |
| **Group** | Resource scope boundary — quotas, secrets, memory | `groups/{name}.yaml` |

## Reference Format

```
{type}/{name}@{version}     e.g. skillsets/web-search@0.2.0
```

- Always an exact semver — `latest`, branches, and commit hashes are forbidden
- The registry resolves references; paths are never hardcoded
- Published version directories are immutable — changes ship as new versions

## Skillsets

A skill is an async Python function; its tool schema is generated from the signature and
docstring — no hand-written JSON schema.

```python
@skill
async def search(ctx: SkillContext, query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> list[dict]:
    """Run a web search and return the top results."""
    ...
```

Key rules: async-first, access secrets/logging via `SkillContext` only, timeouts declared
in `skillset.yaml`, failures raised as exceptions (converted at the agentd boundary).

**Import `SkillContext` at runtime, not under `TYPE_CHECKING`.** The tool schema is
derived from your signature via `get_type_hints()`. If a name in the annotations cannot
be resolved at runtime, that call raises and the framework falls back to *no* schema —
the model then sees untyped parameters and cannot tell what to pass:

```python
# Wrong — get_type_hints() raises NameError, every parameter loses its type
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from malkuth.core.skill import SkillContext

# Right
from malkuth.core.skill import SkillContext, skill
```

The framework warns (`skill type hints could not be resolved` /
`skill parameters have no type`) rather than failing, so dynamically defined skills stay
possible. `LoadedSkillset.untyped_parameters()` reports the same thing per tool.

## Promptsets

Templates are selected by graph `node_id` (or `default` for direct requests). Variables
are declared with schemas — rendering with undeclared variables fails (`MOD_004`) rather
than silently producing empty text. Locale overrides live in `locales/{lang}/`.
Any prompt wording change requires a version bump.

## Memorysets

A memoryset pins the policy of a memory space: scope (`run | local | group | global`),
embedding model (fixed per version), chunking, hybrid search weights, retention/compaction,
and recall defaults (k, min score, token budget). Attachment location must match the
scope: manifest (local), graph (run), `groups/<name>.yaml` (group),
`groups/global.yaml` (global).

## Graphs

The graph is the wiring module: attaching or detaching an agent is a YAML change only.

- `mode: mission` — terminates at END; cycles require `max_iterations`
- `mode: service` — perpetual; requires an idle backoff policy, checkpoints per iteration
- `connections` — the A2A peer-call allowlist (direction matters, peers stay equal)
- Deploy-time validation rejects dangling refs, unreachable nodes, and mode violations

## Groups

A group scopes resources — quotas, secrets, group memory — for its member agents.
It never affects wiring: same-group agents still need declared `connections` to call
each other. Resource lookup resolves **local > group > global**.

## Compatibility & Versioning

- Agents pin exact module versions; deploy validation cross-checks requirements
  (e.g. skillset `requires.env` ⊆ agent `env_allowlist`)
- Breaking-change guide (semver): tool rename/signature change/removal and required
  prompt-variable changes → **major**; backward-compatible additions → minor;
  graph state schema changes → major; embedding model changes → minor+ with full reindex
