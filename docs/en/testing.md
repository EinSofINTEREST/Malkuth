# Testing Strategy

**[한국어](../ko/testing.md)** | English

How Malkuth stays deterministic around non-deterministic models. Normative rules:
[06-testing.md](../../.claude/rules/06-testing.md).

## Principles

1. **Tests never call a real LLM** — a scripted `FakeModel` (or recorded cassettes)
   stands in. CI has no provider API keys on purpose; a test that needs one is a bug.
2. **Tests never depend on external services** — Docker fixtures (testcontainers) or
   fakes only.
3. **Deterministic and parallelizable** — time-dependent logic (backoff, health
   intervals, service idle) is tested with injected clocks, never `sleep`.
4. Embeddings use a deterministic hash-based fake — no embedding API calls.

## Test Pyramid & Layout

```
tests/
├── unit/           # no external deps — mirrors src/malkuth structure   (~70%)
├── integration/    # Docker / real MCP server fixtures                  (~25%)
├── e2e/            # full compose stack, fake LLM provider container    (~5%)
└── fixtures/       # FakeModel, fake MCP server, builders, test yamls
```

- Markers: `@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.e2e`
- `make test` runs unit only; `make test-integration` and `make test-e2e` are separate
- E2E runs nightly in CI (`ci-nightly.yml`), not as a PR gate

## What Must Be Covered

| Area | Focus |
|---|---|
| core | manifest / topology / group schema validation, scope resolution |
| orchestrator | config → StateGraph build, routing, state merge, mission & service mode rules |
| protocols | error mapping to `MalkuthError`, A2A allowlist, tool namespacing |
| modules | ref parsing, schema snapshots (skillsets), render goldens (promptsets) |
| memory | space ACL, alias resolution (local > group > global), hybrid search merge, recall budget |
| agentd | tool loop bounds, cancellation cleanup, direct-task handling |
| runtime | container lifecycle, quota rejection (`RT_006`), drain semantics |

Service graphs additionally require: iteration accumulation, idle backoff progression,
drain-mid-iteration resume, and failure-streak halt (`GRAPH_005`) scenarios.

## Quality Gates (CI-enforced)

```bash
make lint          # ruff check + ruff format --check
make typecheck     # mypy — strict on src/malkuth/core
make test          # pytest unit + coverage ≥ 70% (fails below)
make test-integration
```

Coverage: a **single enforced gate** — ≥ 70% across `src/malkuth`, enforced by
`make test` via pytest-cov `--cov-fail-under=70`. The 90%+ (critical paths) and 100%
(error-conversion paths) figures are review targets, not separate CI gates.
Check names and merge-gate wiring: [ci/status-checks.md](ci/status-checks.md).

## Known Limitations

What the suite does **not** prove, so nobody mistakes green for complete:

- **No real model is ever called.** Unit tests use `FakeModel`; E2E runs the
  **standard executor** against a deterministic fake provider that speaks the
  Messages API — so prompt rendering, the tool loop, output shaping, and the
  provider binding all execute. What is still absent is a real provider's own
  behaviour: token limits, streaming quirks, provider-side rate limiting.
- **No real embedding API.** Memory tests use `HashEmbedder`, which is deterministic
  but does not model semantic similarity. Recall *ranking quality* is therefore not
  measured; only the merge, threshold, and budget mechanics are.
- **MCP is covered only in-process.** The `mcp` binding is exercised against a
  reference server process, crossing the real SDK but not a container boundary
  — see the Docker note below. (A2A now crosses one; see below.)
- **Docker-dependent tests skip without a daemon.** Integration and E2E tests report
  as skipped on machines without Docker. A green local run is not evidence that the
  container paths work — check the CI job.
- **A2A now crosses containers; transitive delegation does not.** Declared
  calls, undeclared directions, forged tokens, and the depth limit (`A2A_005`)
  are all checked across live containers in `tests/e2e/test_a2a.py`. The depth
  limit is verified by *injecting* a depth, not by an agent actually delegating
  onward — an agent calling a peer mid-task is still unproven end to end.
- **Auto-recall is not covered end to end.** The embedding provider binding
  exists and is exercised against a fake endpoint, but the E2E stack does not
  yet serve one — so memory accumulation feeding a later task's prompt is
  proven only in unit tests. Ranking quality remains unmeasured either way
  (see the embedding note above).
- **Service runs survive an orchestrator restart, not an agent one.** A service
  run's checkpoints, its stored iteration count, and an externally-left drain
  request all survive a new orchestrator process reopening the same Postgres
  checkpointer and run store (`tests/e2e/test_service_restart.py`). What is
  *not* covered is killing an **agent** container mid-iteration: the restart
  boundary exercised here is the orchestrator's, not the agent's.
